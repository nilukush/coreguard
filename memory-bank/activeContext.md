### System Engagement
Last Memory Bank Initialization: 17/02/2025, 5:36:50 pm (Asia/Dubai, UTC+4:00)
- All core files verified and current
- Documentation status: Complete and accurate
- Development mode implementation complete

### Current Implementation

1. Development Mode Features:
   - Implemented DevelopmentNotificationHandler without system dependencies
   - Status bar menu integration with retained instances
   - Throttled notifications with detailed app usage
   - Improved event loop with better timing
   - Default CPU threshold (75%)
   - Removed all UserNotifications framework dependencies
   - Resource files properly excluded from build

2. Core Functionality:
   - CPU monitoring operational
   - Threshold detection working
   - Menu bar updates functioning
   - Mock performance metrics for testing

3. System Integration:
   - Bypassed bundle requirements with development mode
   - Notifications shown in status bar menu
   - Visual alerts in menu bar icon
   - Console logging for debugging

### Technical Details

1. Implementation Chain:
   ```
   main.swift (retained instances)
   → NSApplication setup
   → StatusBarController.init
   → Menu Setup with retained references
   → DevelopmentNotificationHandler (with menu)
   → CoreMonitor with throttling
   → Optimized event loop
   ```

2. Key Improvements:
   - Throttled notifications (5s interval, max 3 consecutive)
   - Detailed app usage in notifications
   - Reduced console output
   - Proper instance retention
   - Optimized event loop timing
   - Clean build configuration

2. Development Features:
   - Status bar notification display
   - Console logging for debugging
   - Visual menu bar alerts
   - Threshold management
   - Mock performance data

### Next Steps

1. Feature Development:
   - Add CPU usage history
   - Implement app whitelist/blacklist
   - Add custom notification rules
   - Enhance performance metrics

2. Testing:
   - Verify threshold detection
   - Test notification delivery
   - Validate menu updates
   - Profile performance impact

3. Future Production Requirements:
   - Document bundle setup process
   - List required certificates
   - Detail system integration steps
   - Outline deployment process
